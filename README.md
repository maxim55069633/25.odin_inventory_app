This is a simple Express application that uses Mongoose to perform CRUD operations on a MongoDB database. This project is based on [MDN's local library tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)

I learn:

1. how to upload images using `Multer`
2. how to limit repeated requests to APIs and endpoints using `express-rate-limit`
3. how to format Date using `luxon`

Sample:
